# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our community prioritizes mutual respect, empathy, and kindness, with a goal of building a positive environment for all contributors.

## Our Standards

Positive examples of behavior that help to foster a collaborative and friendly environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect for others
- Welcoming diverse viewpoints and experiences
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole, rather than individual gain
- Collaborating to resolve conflicts in a professional and productive manner

Unacceptable behaviors that violate our community standards include:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal and political attacks
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Publishing personal information (such as physical or email addresses) without explicit consent
- Any other actions that might reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are tasked with upholding and enforcing the standards of this Code of Conduct. Leaders will take appropriate and fair corrective actions in response to any behavior they deem as inappropriate, threatening, or harmful. 

Community leaders hold the right to remove, edit, or reject any contributions (code, comments, commits, issues, etc.) that do not align with the communityâ€™s standards. Reasons for moderation or decision-making will be communicated when necessary to ensure transparency and understanding.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces, including but not limited to GitHub, forums, mailing lists, social media, and events related to Pi Py Ir, whether online or offline. 

It also applies when a community member is acting as a representative of the Pi Py Ir project in public spaces. For instance, using an official email, social media account, or participating in events as a project ambassador is subject to this code of conduct.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders at [insert email/contact point]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly, with confidentiality maintained where necessary to protect the identity and privacy of the reporter.

All members of the community leadership team are obligated to maintain the privacy and security of the person reporting any incidents. Retaliation against those who report code of conduct violations is strictly prohibited.
